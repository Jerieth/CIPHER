[2024-10-11 18:36:53] Jereith: What can you tell me about ship weapons?
[2024-10-11 18:37:04] CIPHER: Absolutely! Hereâ€™s a concise overview of ship weapons:

### Ship Weapons Overview

1. **Lasers**:
   - **Description**: Require power from the ship's power core to fire.
   - **Strengths**: 
     - Very accurate.
     - Effective against heavily shielded ships, especially ion-based shields.
     - Can penetrate both shields and armor.
   - **Weaknesses**: 
     - Damage output depends on power allocation.

2. **Missiles**:
   - **Description**: Explode on impact or within a specified range.
   - **Strengths**: 
     - Effective against both shields and armor.
     - Can cause damage through the shockwave of the explosion.
     - Donâ€™t require precise targeting.
   - **Weaknesses**: 
     - Exhaustible resource; must be reloaded.
     - Reloading time varies by ship and missile type.

3. **Auto-Cannons**:
   - **Description**: Operate independently of the power core.
   - **Strengths**: 
     - Can function even when the main power is down.
     - Effective against small, agile targets.
     - Damage output can be increased with additional turrets.
   - **Weaknesses**: 
     - Low accuracy; require manual targeting.
     - Typically do less damage than lasers or missiles.

### Tactical Considerations
- **Choosing Weapons**: The effectiveness of each weapon can depend on the enemy type and your overall mission objectives. For example:
  - **Against heavily armored ships**: Use a combination of Ion Lasers and Missiles.
  - **Against fast fighters**: Auto-Cannons may be more effective.
